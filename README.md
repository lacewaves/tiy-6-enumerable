# Enumerable Excercise
#### Back-End Engineering at The Iron Yard
Enumerable is a short Ruby program that demonstrates ways to manipulate data stored in arrays. It includes splitting strings, using methods to find information about words in an array, or creating new arrays by selecting specific items. This was created as part of the coursework in a 12 week immersive back-end engineering course at The Iron Yard.
